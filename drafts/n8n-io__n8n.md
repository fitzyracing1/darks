Hi! A few workflows on `master` have been dark recently. Details below, in case they're useful:

### Security: Sync from Public (`.github/workflows/sec-sync-public-to-private.yml`)

- Latest run on `master`: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/actions/runs/41200172086 — dark (conclusion: `skipped`), 2026-10-31 12:13 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-10-13 15:19 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Likely cause: run skipped

### Test: E2E Coverage Nightly (`.github/workflows/test-e2e-coverage-nightly.yml`)

- Latest run on `master`: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/actions/runs/41158290335 — dark (conclusion: `failure`), 2026-10-31 02:04 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-10-31 02:04 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Job / step: `Unit Coverage (CLI integration + Postgres)`
- Likely cause: The job has exceeded the maximum execution time of 6h0m0s

If this is already known or expected, feel free to close. Thanks for maintaining n8n!
