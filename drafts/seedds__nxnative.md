Hi! A few workflows on `main` have been dark recently. Details below, in case they're useful:

### fuzz (`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`)

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/seedds/nxnative/actions/runs/42014086151 — dark (conclusion: `failure`), 2026-11-05 10:50 UTC

- Job / step: `Fuzz the file parsers` → `Run each harness`
