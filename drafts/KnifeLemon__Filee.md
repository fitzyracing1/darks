## Body

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Hi! The **CI** workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on `main` has been getting cancelled since 2026-11-10. Here is what I saw, in case it's useful:

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/KnifeLemon/Filee/actions/runs/43122968194 — dark (conclusion: `cancelled`), 2026-11-11 23:51 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-11-10 18:31 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Job / step: `build`
- Likely cause: Canceling since a higher priority waiting request for ci-refs/heads/main exists

If this is already known or expected, feel free to close. Thanks for maintaining Filee!
