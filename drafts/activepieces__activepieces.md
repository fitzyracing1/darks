Hi! A few workflows on `main` have been dark recently. Details below, in case they're useful:

### Chat Evals (`.github/workflows/agent-evals.yml`)

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/actions/runs/42173268631 — dark (conclusion: `failure`), 2026-11-06 06:15 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-10-13 06:26 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Job / step: `Live judge gate` → `Run live chat evals (scope=regression)`
- Likely cause: Error: Hook timed out in 540000ms. (packages/server/worker/test/lib/agent-eval/agent-eval.test.ts:20)
