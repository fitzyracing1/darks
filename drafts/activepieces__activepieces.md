<!-- END TITLE -->

## Body

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Hi! The **Chat Evals** workflow (`.github/workflows/agent-evals.yml`) on `main` has been failing since 2026-10-13. Here is what I saw, in case it's useful:

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/actions/runs/40168717610 — dark (conclusion: `failure`), 2026-10-25 06:20 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-10-13 06:26 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Job / step: `Live judge gate` → `Run live chat evals (scope=regression)`
- Likely cause: AssertionError: see the eval report above for the failing checks: expected [ …(4) ] to deeply equal [] (packages/server/worker/test/lib/agent-eval/agent-eval.test.ts:58)
