Hi! A few workflows on `main` have been dark recently. Details below, in case they're useful:

### Docker Build, Test, and Publish (`.github/workflows/docker.yml`)

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/actions/runs/42537622455 — dark (conclusion: `cancelled`), 2026-11-08 23:57 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-11-08 17:58 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Likely cause: run cancelled

### Deploy Site (`.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml`)

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/actions/runs/42534747477 — dark (conclusion: `cancelled`), 2026-11-08 23:21 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-11-08 23:15 UTC (first run of the current streak)

If this is already known or expected, feel free to close. Thanks for maintaining hermes-agent!
