CI: "FreeBSD" workflow getting cancelled on main since 2026-10-18
<!-- END TITLE -->

## Body

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Hi! The **FreeBSD** workflow (`.github/workflows/freebsd.yml`) on `main` has been getting cancelled since 2026-10-18. Here is what I saw, in case it's useful:

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/storytold/pdfcraft/actions/runs/39290920746 — dark (conclusion: `cancelled`), 2026-10-19 17:03 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-10-18 07:11 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Job / step: `freebsd / FreeBSD 15 aarch64 (build + test)` → `Build and test`
- Likely cause: Canceling since a higher priority waiting request for freebsd-refs/heads/main exists

<details><summary>End of the job log</summary>
