CI: "FreeBSD" workflow failing on main since 2026-11-08
<!-- END TITLE -->

## Body

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Hi! The **FreeBSD** workflow (`.github/workflows/freebsd.yml`) on `main` has been failing since 2026-11-08. Here is what I saw, in case it's useful:

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/storytold/lightcraft/actions/runs/42446116237 — dark (conclusion: `failure`), 2026-11-08 04:16 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-11-08 04:16 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Job / step: `freebsd / FreeBSD 15 x86_64 (build + test)` → `Build and test`
- Likely cause: process didn't exit successfully: '/var/tmp/craft-target/debug/deps/lightcraft-5b7b3a2fe070bd44' (signal: 11, SIGSEGV: invalid memory reference)

<details><summary>End of the job log</summary>
