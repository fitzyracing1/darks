<!-- END TITLE -->

## Body

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Hi! The **SonarCloud** workflow (`.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml`) on `main` has been failing since 2026-11-01. Here is what I saw, in case it's useful:

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/storytold/lightcraft/actions/runs/41678437291 — dark (conclusion: `failure`), 2026-11-03 16:51 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-11-01 17:29 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Job / step: `sonarcloud / SonarCloud Scan` → `SonarCloud Scan`
- Likely cause: Action failed: The process '/opt/hostedtoolcache/sonar-scanner-cli/8.3.0-build.16463/linux-x64/bin/sonar-scanner' failed with exit code 1
