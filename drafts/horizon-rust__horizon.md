## Body

<!-- BEGIN BODY -->
Hi! The **mojang republish** workflow (`.github/workflows/mojang-republish.yml`) on `main` has been failing since 2026-11-12. Here is what I saw, in case it's useful:

- Latest run on `main`: https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/actions/runs/43566643125 — dark (conclusion: `failure`), 2026-11-14 06:30 UTC
- Dark since: 2026-11-12 20:01 UTC (first run of the current streak)
- Job / step: `check`
- Likely cause: System.IO.IOException: No space left on device : '/home/ludovic/.actions-runners/horizon-light-2/_diag/Worker_20261114-063012-utc.log'

If this is already known or expected, feel free to close. Thanks for maintaining horizon!
